            <Card.Text>
              Hello, everyone! We are excited to announce the launch of the Trans Advocacy and Complaint Collective UK—a new initiative dedicated to advocating for trans rights and addressing transphobia across the UK.

            <Card.Text>
              Our mission is to create a united front for trans people and allies to push back against discrimination, hold media accountable for transphobic content, and ensure that our voices are heard. Whether you’re passionate about activism, need support, or want to help make real change, there’s a place for you in our collective.
